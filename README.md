<h2>Abstract</h2>
This research paper examines the influence that Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation has on future hours worked and future employment of individuals eligible for unemployment benefits during the pandemic. It explores the hypothesis that individuals who are eligible for unemployment benefits are likely to work less upon the conclusion of the pandemic unemployment benefits. The paper examines whether states that terminated unemployment benefits ahead of the nationwide conclusion are associated with higher levels of employment, comparing them to states that retained these benefits for longer durations. This work will highlight different trends surrounding unemployment benefits from the pandemic and the role that they play in individual working decisions. The results provide insight that FPUC-2 played a large role on future employment and that individuals are less likely to return to work after FPUC-2 if they were eligible for benefits.
